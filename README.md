# Example analyses with RIBBIT
These notebooks show how we used RIBBIT to search for _Pseudacris maculata_ (cs1) and _Atelopus varius_ (cs2) using RIBBIT, in Python and R. The notebooks perform analysis only on a few files for the purpose of demonstration. 

For information on how to install and use RIBBIT, please see see [OpenSoundscape](https://opensoundscape.org) (Python) or [r-ribbit](https://github.com/kitzeslab/r-ribbit) (R).
